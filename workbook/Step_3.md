# Step 3 - Create a Github Repository

1. While still logged into Github.com, click the **+** icon up in the top right
corner.
2. Enter a name for your repository, for example: "tech-tue-cloud-workstation"

_If the webpage indicates that the repository name is not available, append some
digits to the end of the repository name._

3. Provide a description of the repository, such as: "Tech Tuesday - Use TF to
create a cloud workstation"

4. Make the repository private for now. (You can always make it public later by
changing it the Repository Settings.)

5. Click the **Add a README file** checkbox and then,

6. Click the **Create Repository** button. In a moment, you repository will be
created.

7. Now, lets clone this barebones repo to our AWS CloudShell. Click the green
**Code** button. This will open a window with the URL to your repository.

8. Click the clipboard icon to the right of the repo URL (in the popup that just
opened).

9. Now, navigate to the tab with CloudShell open. Click to plant your curser.
Type `git clone ` and then paste in the url from your clipboard. Hit enter.

10. When prompted enter your Github username and password. **NOTE: You will NOT
see your password reflected back to you as you type it into the CloudShell terminal.

11. Type `ls` at the prompt in the CloudShell terminal and hit enter. You should
see a response that corresponds to the name you gave your repo.

12. next type `cd tech` (where "tech" is the first few letters of your repo name)
and the hit tab and enter. Isn't tab completion wonderful? You should now be in
the directory that contains your barebones repository code.
